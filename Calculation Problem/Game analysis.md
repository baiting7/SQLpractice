# Game Analysis
## 1. Find the first login date for each player
### Question1
https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-i/
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the first login date for each player.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+-------------+
| player_id | first_login |
+-----------+-------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01  |
| 2         | 2017-06-25  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02  |
+-----------+-------------+
#### Solution1ï¼šuse ```Group by```
```
select player_id, min(event_date) as first_login
from Activity
group by player_id
```
#### Analysis
Use MIN() Function to get the first login date.
#### Solution2: use Window function ```MIN() OVER()```
```
SELECT DISTINCT player_id,
MIN(event_date) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id) AS first_login
FROM Activity
ORDER BY player_id ASC
```
## 2. Find the device that is first logged in for each player
### Question2
https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-ii/
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

Write a SQL query that reports the device that is first logged in for each player.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+-----------+
| player_id | device_id |
+-----------+-----------+
| 1         | 2         |
| 2         | 3         |
| 3         | 1         |
+-----------+-----------+
#### Solution1: use SUBQUERY ```IN```
```
SELECT player_id,device_id
FROM activity
WHERE (player_id,event_date) IN (
SELECT player_id,MIN(event_date)
FROM activity
GROUP BY player_id)
```
#### Analyis
```where (a, b) in (select a, b from t) ```
#### Solution2: use ```JOIN```
```
select distinct a.player_id, a.device_id
from activity a
join (select player_id, min(event_date) as first_d 
  from activity group by player_id) b
on a.event_date = b.first_d and a.player_id = b.player_id
order by a.player_id
```
#### Solution3: use Window function ```RANK() OVER()```
```
select player_id, device_id from
(select player_id, device_id, 
rank() over (partition by player_id order by event_date) rank
from activity) a
where a.rank = 1
```
#### Analysis
Using window function is faster.
## 3. Find the cumulative game score
### Question3
https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-iii/
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 1         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| player_id | event_date | games_played_so_far |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01 | 5                   |
| 1         | 2016-05-02 | 11                  |
| 1         | 2017-06-25 | 12                  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02 | 0                   |
| 3         | 2018-07-03 | 5                   |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.
#### Solution: use Window function ```SUM() OVER()```
```
select player_id, event_date, 
sum(games_played) over (partition by player_id order by event_date) as games_played_so_far
from Activity
group by player_id, event_date
```
## 4. Find the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the first login
### Question
https://leetcode.com/problems/game-play-analysis-iv/
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+
| fraction  |
+-----------+
| 0.33      |
+-----------+
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33
#### Solution
```
select round(count(distinct player_id)/(select count(distinct player_id) from Activity),2) as fraction 
from
(select player_id, event_date, 
 lead(event_date) over (partition by player_id order by event_date) as pervious_date,
 min(event_date) over (partition by player_id) as first_date
 from Activity) t
where DATEDIFF(pervious_date, event_date)=1----limit the consective login
and first_date = event_date----limit the first login
```
#### Analysis
Use window function to calucate the second login and limit the day which is the day after the first login day.
