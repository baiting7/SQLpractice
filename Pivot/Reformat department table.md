## Question
https://leetcode.com/problems/reformat-department-table/
### Solution1: use ```PIVOT```
```
Select * from
(Select id, revenue, month from department)
pivot(
min(revenue) for month in ('Jan' Jan_Revenue, 'Feb' Feb_Revenue, 'Mar' Mar_Revenue,
'Apr' Apr_Revenue, 'May' May_Revenue, 'Jun' Jun_Revenue,
'Jul' Jul_Revenue, 'Aug' Aug_Revenue, 'Sep' Sep_Revenue,
'Oct' Oct_Revenue, 'Nov' Nov_Revenue, 'Dec' Dec_Revenue))
```
### Solution2: use ```sum(case when...then...)```
```
select id, 
	sum(case when month = 'jan' then revenue else null end) as Jan_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'feb' then revenue else null end) as Feb_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'mar' then revenue else null end) as Mar_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'apr' then revenue else null end) as Apr_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'may' then revenue else null end) as May_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'jun' then revenue else null end) as Jun_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'jul' then revenue else null end) as Jul_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'aug' then revenue else null end) as Aug_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'sep' then revenue else null end) as Sep_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'oct' then revenue else null end) as Oct_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'nov' then revenue else null end) as Nov_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'dec' then revenue else null end) as Dec_Revenue
from department
group by id
order by id
```
### Solution3: use 
```
select id,
sum(if(month='Jan',revenue,null)) as Jan_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Feb',revenue,null)) as Feb_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Mar',revenue,null)) as Mar_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Apr',revenue,null)) as Apr_Revenue,
sum(if(month='May',revenue,null)) as May_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Jun',revenue,null)) as Jun_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Jul',revenue,null)) as Jul_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Aug',revenue,null)) as Aug_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Sep',revenue,null)) as Sep_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Oct',revenue,null)) as Oct_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Nov',revenue,null)) as Nov_Revenue,
sum(if(month='Dec',revenue,null)) as Dec_Revenue
from Department
group by id
```
